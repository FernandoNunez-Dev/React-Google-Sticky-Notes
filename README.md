<h3>With This React Application<h3>
    I utilized props and state to put together a small React Sticky Note Application. Inspired by google's Keeper planner. Sort of a little twist to a todo list. I aimed at trying to be a bit differrent. As todo apps are everywhere now a days. This application uses state to track the current sticky notes added  as well as the text that the user has entered. Although event handlers and like onclick appear to be rendered inline, they will be collected and implemented using event delegation.

<h3>I Incorporated External Plugins</h3>
    that are being used and rendered with some of the applications's components.
    React allows you to interface with other libraries and frameworks. For example,I incorporated [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) a remarkable components library to convert the <textarea>â€™s value in real time in this application along with some icons aswell.

<h2 align="center">Recommended Tools</h2>



The following tools are recommended for a React project. Also you will find included below some links for building some complex UI animations and conversion of SVG image into Data URL with the help of Webpack loader.
   
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com) UI and components library.
- [ESLint-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/eslint-loader), When using with transpiling loaders(like babel-loader),make sure they are in correct order(bottom to top). Otherwise files will be checked after being processed by babel-loader.
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/building-a-complex-ui-animation-in-react-simply), For building complex UI animations in React.
- [Webpack CSS-loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/) interprets @import and url() like import/require() and will resolve them.
- [SVG-React-Webpack](https://www.pluralsightcomguides-how-to-load-svg-with-react-and-webpack) To utilize  an SVG image in your React project, it will have to be transformed into a Data URL. We will need an  appropriate webpack loader in our bundler.
